# ThePerfectDonuts
This is a java based command line billing software developed for the store "The perfect donuts" when I was in the 10th grade(2014).  

It mainly consists of a fixed menu of items which can be changed as needed including donuts, bites(different kind of donut) and beverages.  

The items can also be chosen in smart ways as suggested by the software to avail any ongoing offers with different combinations of items.  

A final bill is generated based on the selections along with the offers selected(if any) and taxes for the customer.
